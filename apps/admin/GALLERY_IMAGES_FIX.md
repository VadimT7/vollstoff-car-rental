# Gallery Images Fix

## Problem
Gallery images were not being saved properly when creating or editing vehicles in the admin dashboard, resulting in only the primary image being displayed on the car details page.

## Root Cause
The vehicle update (PUT) endpoint in `apps/admin/app/api/vehicles/[id]/route.ts` was missing gallery image processing logic. It only handled primary image uploads but ignored gallery images sent from the frontend.

## Solution

### 1. Added Gallery Image Processing to PUT Endpoint
- **File**: `apps/admin/app/api/vehicles/[id]/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added gallery image extraction from FormData (lines 169-180)
  - Added gallery image upload to Vercel Blob Storage (lines 182-222)
  - Added database updates for CarImage records (lines 297-325)

### 2. Enhanced Web API Response
- **File**: `apps/web/app/api/vehicles/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated the images array to include both primary and gallery images
  - Primary image is first, followed by gallery images
  - Filters out non-gallery images to avoid duplicates

### 3. Updated Car Details Page
- **File**: `apps/web/app/cars/[slug]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced image carousel with navigation arrows
  - Added keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
  - Added image counter and improved thumbnails
  - Better responsive design and accessibility

## How It Works

### Backend Flow:
1. **Form Submission**: Frontend sends FormData with `galleryImage_0`, `galleryImage_1`, etc.
2. **Extraction**: Backend extracts all files starting with `galleryImage_`
3. **Upload**: Each image is uploaded to Vercel Blob Storage
4. **Database**: CarImage records are created with `isGallery: true`

### Frontend Flow:
1. **API Call**: Vehicle API returns both primary and gallery images
2. **Display**: Car details page shows all images in an enhanced carousel
3. **Navigation**: Users can navigate using arrows, thumbnails, or keyboard

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Create New Vehicle**:
   - Go to Fleet > Add New Vehicle
   - Upload a primary image and multiple gallery images
   - Save the vehicle
   - Check that all images are saved

2. **Edit Existing Vehicle**:
   - Go to Fleet > Edit Vehicle
   - Add/change gallery images
   - Save the vehicle
   - Verify images are updated

3. **View on Website**:
   - Go to the car details page
   - Verify all images appear in the carousel
   - Test navigation arrows and thumbnails
   - Check responsive behavior

## Features Added

✅ **Gallery Image Upload**: Both create and edit forms now save gallery images  
✅ **Vercel Blob Storage**: All images are stored in the cloud  
✅ **Enhanced Carousel**: Beautiful image navigation with arrows and thumbnails  
✅ **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate images  
✅ **Image Counter**: Shows current image position (e.g., "2 / 5")  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if images fail to upload  

## Dependencies

- `@vercel/blob`: For cloud image storage
- Environment variable: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` must be configured

## Notes

- Gallery images are replaced (not appended) when editing a vehicle
- Primary image is always shown first in the carousel
- Images are uploaded with timestamps to ensure unique filenames
- The system gracefully handles missing or failed image uploads
